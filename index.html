    <p>Kerala State has 941 Grama Panchayats, 152 Block Panchayats, 14 District Panchayats, 87 Municipalities and 6 Corporations.
        Consequent to the 73rd and 74th amendments to the Constitution, the three-tier system came into existence in India . 
        In Kerala, Local Self-Government Institutions have been meaningfully empowered through massive transfer of resources as well as administrative powers.<br> 
        Local self-government Institutions have emerged as effective agencies for the implementation of developmental programmes. 
        Developmental programmes are identified and implemented through Grama Sabhas. With the decentralisation of power, 
        Local administration department has gained an important role in the formulation and implementation of developmental works at the grass-root level. 
        Today Panchayat Directorate, Directorate of Urban Affairs, Commissionerate of Rural Development and Town and Country Planning Department are the major
        allied departments of Local Administration. Related to local administration activities, there are different allied institutions and training centers 
        under LSGD.</p>
